this file I created locall on my computer
I used vi as the editor
typing line by line
ok, well done - so far.
But what's the deal? rebase only before a PR?
Adding a line, just like that!
merged to master and thereby added another line!
point is, adding this line will cause a merge conflict!
but I solved it! Right now! ;)
