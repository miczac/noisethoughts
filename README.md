this is my testrepo or - maybe - git-playground

(is there actually a command like 'git play'?) 

ok, just kidding ;)

this is a serious messup, I'm afraid!

I'm sure there was a linefeed after this ok-line above!
ok, now it's there ...

while the fun continues ...

strange things may happen!

Apparently, as one can see, I had only little time during the past year ... darn school!
No time for projects, just teaching and preparing lectures!
But ... it gets me money on a regular basis, so ...
And, it will get better!  ;)

That's what I thought ... back then!  :/
